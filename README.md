# Asteroid-Dash
Turn-based space game
The Asteroid Dash project is a C++ game where players control a spacecraft navigating a grid-based space environment while dodging asteroids and collecting power-ups. The game involves implementing dynamic memory management, linked lists, and real-time event handling to simulate the mechanics of a space adventure.

Asteroids move from the right to the left of the grid, and the player can maneuver the spacecraft to avoid collisions or fire projectiles to destroy incoming threats. Each asteroid has multiple rotation states, dynamically updated upon being hit. Power-ups such as extra lives or ammunition add strategic elements, and the scoring system rewards players for survival, successful hits, and asteroid destruction.

The game leverages a leaderboard to track high scores across sessions, dynamically maintaining the top ten results. Players interact with the game using commands like moving, shooting, or printing the grid state. Gameplay progresses in real-time as the system processes commands and updates the grid accordingly. The project emphasizes object-oriented design, efficient memory management, and dynamic updates to celestial object states, making it both a challenging and educational programming assignment.
